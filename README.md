# Project Content :

 # 1. üîç Project Overview :
Maven Toys, a retail chain specializing in toys and games, 
operates multiple stores across various cities. Despite having a wide range of 
products and a growing number of stores, the company is struggling 
with inefficient inventory management, unclear sales performance 
trends, and suboptimal profitability. The management lacks actionable 
insights to make informed decisions about stock replenishment, product 
pricing, and store performance. This has led to issues such as overstocking, 
stockouts, and missed sales opportunities, ultimately affecting the company's 
bottom line. 
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data, inventory levels, and 
product performance to identify key trends, inefficiencies, and 
opportunities for improvement.
